# coral-reef-analysis
Final project for MATES Oceanography 2020-2021

## Notes on the project
Currently I don't have the dataset linked as it's around 2.5 gigabytes. This is above github's upload limit but I will attempt to share it in some way.

Thank you to my groupmates Alessandro Barlotta, Don Bonifacio, Logan Bukowski, and Sophia Capili for conducting this project alongside me.
